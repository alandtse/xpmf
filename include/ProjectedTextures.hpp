/**
 * @brief Gives the patched material objects projected textures of their own, profile by profile
 *
 * A single pass material has no textures, the shader lends it four: coverage comes from "the"
 * projected noise, every covered pixel samples "the" projected diffuse, and "the" projected normal
 * and detail normal are blended in. Those textures look global - the engine loads them once, from
 * hardcoded paths under textures\effects, into BSGraphics::State - but they are bound per draw:
 * BSLightingShader::SetupGeometry reads the pointers and puts the textures into pixel shader
 * slots (noise 11, diffuse 3, normal 8, detail normal 10) for every geometry whose technique has
 * PROJECTED_UV, through the renderer's state cache, and nothing else at render time reads them
 * (the normal has one more reader, the sparkle snow material setup, which this leaves alone). So
 * a draw can be handed different textures by pointing State at them for the length of that one
 * call: the engine does the binding, the caching and the deciding (no diffuse or normals with
 * the Prefs setting off or in a cube map pass) exactly as it always did, just with other textures
 * in its hands, and the next projected draw finds the game's where they always were.
 *
 * Those four are all there is. A single pass material object has no texture set, the record's
 * model is never loaded at runtime, and nothing else in the lighting shader's projected UV block
 * samples anything. A set substitutes the ones a profile names and leaves the rest the game's.
 *
 * Which draws, and which textures? Those of shapes that got their projection from a material this
 * plugin patched, and the set of that material's profile - and a shape does not remember its
 * material, but it carries the material's color, copied bit for bit into
 * BSLightingShaderProperty::projectedUVColor by both code paths that apply a material
 * (TESBoundObject::Clone3D and the object LOD builder). So the color carries the set: the lowest
 * bits of its floats' mantissas are overwritten with a signature in red and green and the set's
 * number in blue (tag). Twelve bits of a 23 bit mantissa move a channel by less than one part in
 * two thousand - a fifth of an 8 bit step, invisible - and no arithmetic on colors produces the
 * signature (one chance in 2^24 for an untagged color). Whatever the color is: a material whose
 * profile replaces the diffuse gets white, the texture supplying the color, and one whose profile
 * leaves the diffuse alone keeps its own color and just carries the tag. No bookkeeping, no
 * lifetimes, LOD included.
 *
 * Everything else - moss, another mod's materials, the material objects Community Shaders' True
 * PBR has a configuration for and no profile is written for - keeps sampling the game's textures,
 * because nothing about them or about the engine's pointers was changed.
 *
 * One thing is different about a set for PBR materials: the diffuse. Community Shaders' PBR path
 * expects a base color texture in an sRGB format, which the GPU decodes to linear on sampling -
 * its Diffuse() does no decode of its own under TRUE_PBR - while its projected block, written for
 * the game's non-sRGB ProjectedDiffuse.dds, decodes the projected diffuse in the shader
 * (ColorToLinear). A PBR albedo handed to it as loaded is decoded twice: darker and more
 * saturated than the same texture on the landscape next to it, which on snow reads as blue. So
 * for such a set the diffuse is loaded a second time as its non-sRGB counterpart - same pixels,
 * no decode on sampling - and the shader's decode is the only one, as it is for the landscape.
 * With linear lighting off the same holds: the projected block then decodes nothing, and the PBR
 * base color is put back into sRGB space by Diffuse(). Nothing about the file changes.
 *
 * Community Shaders hooks the same virtual (vtable write, chained). This hook is installed at
 * plugin load, theirs at kPostPostLoad, so theirs wraps this one; neither writes what the other
 * reads. ENB sees ordinary D3D calls coming out of the engine's own state flush.
